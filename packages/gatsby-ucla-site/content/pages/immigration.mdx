  title: COVID-19 in ICE Detention
  subtitle: UCLA Law
  body:
    Our immigration detention research team collects data on COVID-19 infections and deaths of detainees and staff within all 120 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities, as well as other facilities detaining people under ICE jurisdiction, across the United States. Our data come directly from ICEâ€™s website and are updated almost every day.

  note:
    - Actual COVID-19 case counts are likely much higher than reported by ICE, as testing by the agency has been limited.
    - Rates are calculated using a denominator of average facility-level population for 2020. Populations have decreased significantly over the course of the pandemic.
