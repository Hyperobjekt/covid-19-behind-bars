  title: COVID-19 behind bars data project
  subtitle: UCLA Law
  body: We collect and report data on COVID-19 in prisons, jails, and immigration
    detention centers, as well as pandemic-related prison and jail releases,
    legal filings and court orders, and grassroots and community organizing
    efforts. Our team is still in the process of adding all of our
    facility-level data to the national and state maps. Please check back
    regularly for updates.
table:
  title: Facilities with the highest ${metric}
  note:
    - Testing and reporting practices vary widely by correctional agency. True
      case and mortality counts are likely higher and may be significantly
      higher than reported.
    - Rates are calculated using a denominator of facility-level population as
      of February 2020. See our methodology to learn more about why we chose
      this approach.
