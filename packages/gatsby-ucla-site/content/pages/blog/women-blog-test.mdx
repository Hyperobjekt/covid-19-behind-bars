## Introduction 

While recent reforms have sought to address striking disparities and injustices throughout the criminal legal system, the needs of women who are incarcerated are often overlooked. The [fastest-growing population behind bars](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/women_overtime.html), women, both cisgender and transgender, tend to experience particular challenges while incarcerated, from [sexual abuse](https://transequality.org/issues/police-jails-prisons) and psychological trauma to managing pregnancy and motherhood while in prison. 

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the risks and harms that incarcerated women face have only been exacerbated. Overcrowding in female prisons, long a concern for advocates and incarcerated women, has posed a particular threat to health and safety during the pandemic. Because women are often held in lower security institutional environments, many reside in congregate dormitory settings operating well above their designed capacity limits. Even under “normal” conditions in the absence of a pandemic, living in such crowded quarters presents a number of serious health and safety risks: [insufficient access](https://icpa.org/library/towards-a-health-informed-approach-to-penal-reform-evidence-from-ten-countries/) to medical treatment and mental health services, [heightened risk](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6992601/) of physical and sexual abuse, and a [lack of basic sanitation](https://www.aclu.org/issues/prisoners-rights/cruel-inhuman-and-degrading-conditions/overcrowding-and-other-threats-health). 

During the pandemic, however, these conditions have proven especially dangerous and likely wrought deadly consequences. All incarcerated people have faced [elevated risks of exposure to and infection from COVID-19](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2768249), but in the overcrowded facilities that women are often confined in, maintaining physical distance has been all but impossible. Access to medical care and basic sanitation, already limited, has become a matter of life and death.

In addition to the devastating toll the virus itself has exacted on incarcerated women, the restrictions and harsh conditions that women have been subject to behind bars during the pandemic have exacted a devastating psychological toll and compounded the ongoing trauma. The vast majority of incarcerated women are [survivors of trauma and abuse](https://www.safetyandjusticechallenge.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/overlooked-women-in-jails-report-web.pdf), and, even in “normal” times, the isolation, deprivation, and harsh conditions of prison environments have devastating impacts on the mental and physical health of women. As in-person visitation has been suspended [without being replaced by](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2020/09/11/free-calls/) alternative forms of communication, prison responses have made it more difficult for incarcerated women to maintain relationships with loved ones on the outside — including for the more than [60% of women in state prisons](https://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/incarcerated-women-and-girls/) and [80% in jails](https://www.safetyandjusticechallenge.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/overlooked-women-in-jails-report-web.pdf) who are mothers. 

By and large, the carceral system has failed to adopt a gender-responsive approach to managing the pandemic, exacerbating the systemic harms that incarcerated women already face and the traumas of living under such dangerous conditions during a deadly pandemic. A [recent report](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/24/opinion/anti-zionism-anti-semitism.html) by the COVID, Corrections, and Oversight Project highlights these shortcomings while issuing a number of invaluable and specific recommendations, including releasing and diverting women from prisons while taking steps to reduce immediate harms to women who are left inside.

Our report focuses on the many impacts of COVID-19 on women in American prisons during the pandemic. We aim to highlight trends we’ve witnessed in women’s prisons during the pandemic, draw attention to the lack of transparency from carceral agencies, and, by sharing personal accounts drawn from the first-person oral history archive created by [UCI PrisonPandemic,](https://prisonpandemic.uci.edu/) elevate the voices and experiences of some of the women behind these data points. 

Our report is not comprehensive and does not seek to capture the full experience of the many women living behind bars. Rather, it seeks to illuminate some of the unique burdens that this diverse and often overlooked population has faced during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. In doing so, we hope it brings attention to the injustices and dangers that hundreds of thousands women face every day under incarceration.

## Data shortcomings during a public health crisis  

Since the beginning of the pandemic, countless women’s prisons have seen significant COVID-19 outbreaks — [the Louisiana Correctional Institute for Women](https://apnews.com/article/f31d0a19272193a0f461eb96e5c3d23d), [the Eddie Warrior Correctional Center](https://oklahomawatch.org/2020/09/08/covid-19-is-spreading-in-state-prisons-families-say-oklahoma-is-not-doing-enough/) in Oklahoma, [the Dublin Federal Correctional](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/12/24/coronavirus-outbreak-at-east-bay-womens-prison/) in California, [the Logan Correctional Center](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-coronavirus-testing-illinois-prisons-20201208-hzjrfroiozddvfy5yzlocc2ep4-story.html) in Illinois, [the York Correctional Institution](https://www.ctpost.com/hdn/hrlm/p/callback.html) in Connecticut, the [Waseca Federal Correctional Institution](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2020/12/10/aclu-sues-waseca-federal-womens-prison-over-covid19-response) in Minnesota, and many more. 

In the data that we collect from correctional agencies, we have identified 16,915 documented COVID-19 infections among incarcerated women during the pandemic. However, the actual number of women who have been infected is undoubtedly much higher. This figure is limited to cases reported from the 95 state and federal women’s prisons we have identified that publicly post data on cumulative COVID-19 cases for their incarcerated population; many more prisons do not report this information, and as such, we can not know the true number of women who have tested positive while incarcerated. 

The lack of centralization and standards for reporting data disaggregated by gender has made it impossible to consider, at a systemic level, the particular impact of the pandemic on the [more than 230,000 women](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2019women.html) held in U.S. jails and prisons. Across the nearly 80 state, federal, and county agencies from which we collect data, there is not a single prison, jail, or detention system that has consistently reported relevant COVID-19 health data explicitly broken down by gender. [As others have noted](https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/85094), the refusal of carceral agencies to report COVID-19 data disaggregated by demographic factors — race, ethnicity, and age as well aso gender — makes it extremely difficult for policymakers and advocates to know whether particular groups in prison have been disproportionately affected by the virus. 

In the absence of disaggregated data, the best strategy to approximate the epidemiological toll of the virus on incarcerated women is to track the total number of COVID-19 cases reported in women’s facilities or women’s units in mixed facilities. [As we’ve previously noted](https://uclacovidbehindbars.org/blog/scorecard), however, many correctional agencies fail to report COVID-19 data at the facility level, leaving us in the dark as to how many of a state prison system’s total infections occurred inside its women’s prisons. 

Last October, for example, the Florida Department of Corrections (DOC) stopped reporting facility-level data for nearly all COVID-19 metrics. At that time, the agency reported 1,005 COVID-19 cumulative infections at the Lowell Correctional Institution, the largest women’s prison in the country and one with a [disturbing history](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/opinion/editorials/fl-op-edit-florida-prison-abuse-20201225-ux5eb22hljegdfyww7bot464mi-story.html) of rampant abuse. Since October, however, when the DOC began reporting only statewide totals for cumulative infections, it has been impossible to know how many of the more than 18,069 COVID-19 cases reported by the agency were recorded inside Lowell. 

Similarly, Oklahoma, which has [one of the highest female incarceration rates](https://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/incarcerated-women-and-girls/) nationally, also stopped reporting data on cumulative cases disaggregated by facility in October. As a result, we haven’t been able to know how many of the 7,429 cases reported by the Oklahoma DOC came from women’s prisons. 

Even of systems that do report facility-level data, many fail to disaggregate data by gender within mixed facilities that have both men’s and women’s units. For example, the Federal Bureau of Prisons [reports](https://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/) COVID-19 data for the Danbury Correctional Institution; however, they do not report data separately for the [men’s prison, female satellite prison, and female camp](https://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/dan/) contained in the Danbury complex. Similarly, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department manages eight separate jails — including one designated women’s jail — but [reports](https://lasd.org/covid19updates/) only systemwide totals for key variables including the number of cumulative cases and deaths among incarcerated individuals. 

As a result of these limitations, it is impossible to meaningfully compare COVID-19 infection rates across prisons by gender in a broad, comprehensive way. Moreover, without access to data on testing frequency (which just 17 state DOCs [currently report](https://uclacovidbehindbars.org/blog/mayscorecard) at the facility level), it is extremely challenging to reliably compare infection rates across prisons in states like Michigan, which has been conducting weekly surveillance testing, to prisons in states like Alabama, where high case fatality rates (a ratio of COVID-19 deaths to positive tests) suggests that a large number infections have gone undetected. 

Last November, the World Peace Foundation [published](https://sites.tufts.edu/wpf/files/2020/11/Forgotten-Victims-Women-and-COVID-19-Behind-Bars-Final.pdf) the first, and only, research we have identified that presents a nationwide view of COVID-19 inside women’s prisons. Leveraging data we collected, the World Peace Foundation found that 27 women’s prisons each reported more than 100 COVID-19 infections and 17 reported that over 15% of their population tested positive as of the end of September 2020. Since then, we’ve identified at least 45 women’s prisons that have reported more than 100 infections, and 50 that have had cumulative infection rates above 15%. 

## Case studies from California’s women’s prisons 

Given the challenges of quantitatively assessing the impact of the pandemic on women in prisons nationally, we focus on trends in two women’s prisons managed by the California Department of Rehabilitations and Corrections (CDCR): the Central California Women’s Facility (CCWF) in Chowchilla and the California Institution for Women (CIW) in Chino. While these facilities have experienced two of the largest COVID-19 outbreaks among women’s prisons nationally, there is no reason to think they are unique. Instead, what we see when we look closely at developments in CCWF and CIW mirrors stories from prisons across the country, and almost certainly reflects just the beginning of the toll the pandemic has taken on women behind bars. 

CCWF currently holds more than 2,300 women, while CIW holds nearly 1,000 women. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the number of women incarcerated in both prisons has fallen — in CWCF by over 18 percent and in CIW by 40 percent between March of 2020 and today. 

Despite releases, however, both facilities have experienced high cumulative infection rates: 808 women at CCWF have tested positive over the course of the pandemic (34 percent of the current population) along with 489 women at CIW (50 percent of the current population). At CCWF, at the peak of that prison’s massive outbreak in January, one in four women inside had an active COVID-19 infection.

\> I’m not going to lie, things have been rough and very unorganized. We went from a few positive cases to over 500 positive cases in the course of two weeks. There is no way for us to be socially distanced, due to living in eight-man cells. The room I’m currently in had six girls, but two have tested positive. So now it’s four. – Just a Runny Nose? (CCWF, January 2021) 

\> It is very scary to know the virus is in the room and we are not allowed to leave. Even though we clean the room, I’m sure we didn’t get all of it. We are basically sitting here until we all catch it. – In the Room (CCWF, January 2021) 

While the majority of cases at CCWF occurred during a single devastating outbreak which began around Christmas and extended into early January, CIW experienced repeated outbreaks over the course of the pandemic; during four separate outbreaks in May, August, December, and January, more than 50 people in the prison had active infections.

\> It all started with one staff member getting sick. Mind you it was four dorms that held about 75 people. It was six rows that held seven beds that was only two feet apart from each other, so it was no way we could of did the six feet apart because the person who is right across from me could been sick. So it was very easy for me to catch the virus. Mind you we is living inside of a dorm packed together like sardines sharing the same phone. – Easy to Catch (CIW, December 2020) 

The infection rates at these two women’s prisons were far from the highest among all of California’s state prisons. Since the beginning of the pandemic, 99 percent of the current incarcerated population at Avenal State Prison and 90 percent at San Quentin, both men’s prisons, have been infected with COVID-19. 



![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ihLuwdEfhlLdFBaVQ9tuYibGnffP_S3DsDXql93-Q-YkPmvY-UvoFZm6Jy_AWC5oy1G05hBwHvc7UiL1PgSziUc2_ra-Orof5VH8XAPZyHmZ1V07ngibk-j63MA3XYSM96hLtx__)

In 19 of California’s 35 prisons, a majority of all incarcerated individuals have tested positive. In comparison, the cumulative infection rate among the [non-incarcerated population](https://covid19.ca.gov/state-dashboard/) in California as a whole has been just nine percent. 

Given the [extent of overcrowding](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/03/27/photos-show-some-prison-beds-are-only-three-feet-apart) in many prisons before the pandemic struck ([all but three](https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/research/wp-content/uploads/sites/174/2020/03/Tpop1d200304.pdf) of California’s 35 prisons were operating above capacity in March 2020), many more releases and more sustained decarceration could have helped control outbreaks. While CCWF’s prison population fell by more than 500 individuals since last March, the prison has remained overcapacity — 2,356 women are currently held inside the facility, while the design capacity is just 2,004. Most of that decarceration occurred early into the pandemic; over the past few months, the population inside CCWF has begun to creep back up. 

Given the cancellation of in-person visits and lockdown restrictions imposed by CDCR, staff movement has likely been a leading factor in introducing the virus into facilities. In the case of CCWF, an outbreak among staff in early December was quickly followed by a massive outbreak among the incarcerated population just weeks later. 

\> My safety inside here is like being in a bubble suit. The only way we can be exposed is by a staff testing positive which means whether they work in the units, the kitchen, the canteen, etc. everyone around them get quarantined. – In a Bubble Suit (CCWF, December 2020)

This pattern parallels broader trends seen in prisons across the country: prison staff [have faced substantially higher COVID-19 infection rates than the general population](https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(21)00118-5/fulltext), and outbreaks among incarcerated people have [escalated extremely quickly](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7013a2.htm) once the virus enters prison walls. 

Further, staff infections also pose a broad threat to surrounding communities. Prisons have much lower population turnover than jails. And because it is primarily staff who enter and exit prison facilities, it is also likely to be prison staff who primarily drive community transmission from outbreaks originating in prisons.  

\> We are pretty safe so far. We are pretty safe until a staff – state staff – bring it in and expose us. – Half-Faced (CCWF, January 2021)

In total, 227 staff personnel at CCWF and 362 at CIW have tested positive for COVID-19. 

On June 9, 2020, Madonna Watson passed away from COVID-19 and breast cancer while incarcerated at CIW. As her memorial [recounts](https://www.mourningourlosses.org/memorials/madonna-watson?rq=madonna), she is mourned by her many friends and family, including her sisters, her mother, and her son. On March 9, 2021, Esther Griggs died due to complications from COVID-19 while incarcerated at CCWF. During the Honor Lives Lost weekly vigil on March 14, 2021, she was [remembered](https://www.mourningourlosses.org/memorials/esther-griggs) by G. Esteban, who shared that “Esther is someone I will truly miss everyday and always be grateful she befriended me in this harsh and hostile environment. It still doesn’t feel like she is gone.” 

\> I have lost a friend beyond these walls, and two on the other side. I received photos of my youngest sister on a ventilator in April, with no way of obtaining support or saying goodbye. Pre-COVID I would have at least been allowed to see a video. – Taking Its Toll (CIW, December 2020) 

In total, at least 221 incarcerated individuals have died from COVID-19 inside CDCR’s 35 prisons. At least 2,600 deaths from COVID-19 have been recorded nationally across state and federal prisons, including at least 49 inside women’s prisons. 

In December, CDCR began vaccinating staff and incarcerated people across the state’s prisons. So far, nearly 60 percent of incarcerated women at CCWF and 72 percent at CIW have received at least one dose of the vaccine. However, staff vaccine numbers are much lower, despite staff being prioritized in the state’s vaccine distribution plans. [Mirroring a trend](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/) seen across the county, vaccine refusal among prison staff has been worryingly high; to date, just 46 percent of staff at CCWF and 52 percent at CIW have been vaccinated. 

\> I was informed by a CO who wants to remain confidential that they offered the COs a COVID vaccine on the 28, 29, and 30th of December and out of all the staff working the prison, only about 1-15 staff took the vaccine because they are scared of the vaccine. This is crazy because the staff is the one bringing in the COVID-19 to us and it is quickly spreading like wildfire. And the fact they were given the option to get the vaccine and put a stop to exposing us! Is ludicrous. At the end of the day, they get to be home, have medicine, comfortable bed, good bed, medical care if they do get COVID and if we get COVID we are thrown in a cell with other sick inmates and have to experience every painful moment of the sickness and hope we get better fast. – Catching It Now (CCWF, January 2021) 

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/YsPnWsOh5ovxFehTiGbooD3tL3IDayfM5y6j2QH3N9BlCvv9H_yIwm7KjLoNbzVX5Sm5uNkwoU5WgT9HPrji7qD2lUFn9xmX_mXIbZitiiHnzz1XbbFUqha4dli0Pt1T6QyyIOX-)

Several key trends in data from CCWF and CIW are likely not unique to these facilities: high infection rates (especially relative to the non-incarcerated population), insufficient population reduction to allow for physical distancing, staff-initiated outbreaks, and continued low vaccination rates among staff. 

Perhaps more importantly, we also know there remain innumerable untold stories underlying these data points. We hope to motivate additional investigation to shine a light on the experiences of women in prison during the pandemic. 

## Conclusion 

Our efforts to better understand the spread and impact of COVID-19 behind bars have been consistently hampered by the failure of corrections agencies to make accessible and timely data available to the public. Data relating to women’s prisons has been no exception, with the poor quality of the data compromising our ability to understand the impact of COVID-19 on incarcerated women. Even CDCR, which reports more comprehensive data than most other agencies, does not report the number of cumulative tests administered within each facility — only the number of individuals tested over the last 14 days — making it difficult to compare infection rates among the women inside CCWC and CIW to other prisons across California and nationally. 

As we have done since the beginning of the pandemic, we call on agencies to report data disaggregated by facility for core COVID-19 metrics: cumulative cases, deaths, tests administered, population, and vaccinations. It is also critical for agencies to report this data separately by gender for mixed-gender facilities to allow advocates and researchers to better understand the true impact of COVID-19 on incarcerated women. 

As [noted](https://sites.tufts.edu/wpf/files/2020/11/Forgotten-Victims-Women-and-COVID-19-Behind-Bars-Final.pdf) by the World Peace Foundation, “the numerous hurdles that obstruct the physical, mental, emotional and economic well-being of women in prison are not new, but in the pandemic, they gain new capacity to harm.” We echo the need to equip women inside prisons to protect themselves, support efforts that help incarcerated people advocate for themselves, and not allow the current crisis moment distract from the need for systemic change — and significant decarceration — across the carceral system.
