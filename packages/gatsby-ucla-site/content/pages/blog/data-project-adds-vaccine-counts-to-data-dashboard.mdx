This week, the UCLA Law COVID-19 Behind Bars Data Project has added a table on our homepage displaying the numbers of incarcerated people and staff who have received a COVID-19 vaccine within state and federal carceral systems. 

So far, just nine carceral agencies, including eight state departments of corrections and the Federal Bureau of Prisons, are reporting this critical information. Though [media reports have indicated](https://uclacovidbehindbars.org/blog/vaccine-rollout) that additional agencies have begun offering vaccinations to staff and those in custody, we only include information in our dataset that is confirmed and reported by agencies themselves. 

Agencies differ in the exact variables they report related to COVID-19 vaccination. Some report only the number of people who have received any dose, while others report only those who have completed their vaccination schedule, and a few report both. For a number of agencies, the exact definition of the variable is unclear. We have organized the data in a way that reflects, to the best of our knowledge, the number of people who have received at least one dose of the vaccine. The full range of variables reported can be found in [our dataset on GitHub](https://github.com/uclalawcovid19behindbars/data/blob/master/latest-data/state_aggregate_counts.csv).

Since COVID-19 vaccines have become available, advocates and public health experts have urged political authorities to prioritize incarcerated people, as well as the staff they interact with every day, for receipt of vaccines due to their heightened vulnerabilities. Analyses of our data has revealed that incarcerated people have suffered COVID-19 case rates [five times](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2768249) higher than that of the U.S. population as a whole, and prison staff have suffered a case rate [more than three times](https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(21)00118-5/fulltext) greater.

In December 2020, more than 500 health and legal policy experts endorsed our [sign-on letter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rlz5lCDHLCJ4Pnhl0mdNl3VeRSuBu8QWblRtjXu6zN0/edit#) to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices urging the committee to recommend incarcerated populations and prison staff with high and equal priority for receipt of COVID-19 vaccines. Health experts [continue to urge](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2100609) widespread vaccination, paired with decarceration, to slow the spread of COVID-19 behind bars.

Congress is now considering a bill, the [COVID-19 in Corrections Data Transparency Act](https://pressley.house.gov/media/press-releases/pressley-warren-garcia-booker-murray-colleagues-reintroduce-covid-19), which would require federal, state, and local correctional facilities to collect and report, among other information, “the numbers of incarcerated individuals and correctional staff who have been given a first dose of a vaccine, have declined a vaccination, and are fully vaccinated.

In the meantime, we urge all state authorities to offer vaccinations to their incarcerated residents immediately, and to make available health- and legal-related [educational materials](https://uclacovidbehindbars.org/blog/pln-vaccine) to encourage uptake. And we further urge that as they do so, all carceral agencies publish data tracking vaccine roll-outs for the public to ensure a safe, transparent, and effective immunization effort for a population that has suffered a particularly devastating toll from the ongoing pandemic.
