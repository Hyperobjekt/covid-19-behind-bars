## Methodology

### Background

The UCLA Covid-19 Behind Bars Data Project, launched in March 2020, tracks the spread and impact of Covid-19 in American carceral facilities and pushes for greater transparency and accountability around the pandemic response of the carceral system.

Our team of over 90 staff and volunteer researchers gathers and presents timely data about Covid-19 in prisons, jails, youth facilities, and immigration detention centers across the United States.

Since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, shortcomings in data reporting have limited the public’s ability to assess the extent of the spread of the virus. This situation is particularly true for Covid-19 data concerning the approximately two million individuals confined within U.S. jails, prisons, immigrant detention centers, and other carceral settings. Facilities housing incarcerated individuals do not have mandates for Covid-19 testing or precautions, and data reporting for epidemiological monitoring is limited at best. For such a highly-vulnerable population subjected to living in close quarters, the opaque data situation poses a serious problem.

In an effort to centralize the limited data that is available and make it accessible to the general public, the UCLA Covid-19 Behind Bars Data Project has been collecting data on Covid-19 infections and deaths for incarcerated populations and staff within carceral facilities across the U.S. Our methods for collecting and reporting data on prisons and jails differ from those used for data on immigration and youth facilities, and are explained separately below.

We also collect data on prison and jail releases in response to the pandemic, legal filings and court orders bearing on the safety of incarcerated people during the pandemic, and grassroots organizing campaigns and fundraisers.

### Prison and jail data overview

We primarily collect data from federal, state, and local correctional agency websites using web scraping programs that automatically collect reported data three to four times per week.

Our core data of interest include:

- the cumulative number of infections among incarcerated people and staff,
- the cumulative number of deaths among incarcerated people and staff,
- and the cumulative number of tests among incarcerated people and staff.

However, correctional authorities vary in what they report publicly. Pennsylvania, for example, reports data for all six of these core variables, while Mississippi reports data for only one.
We aim to collect and report Covid-19 facility-level data, where possible, from all federal, state, and county correctional agencies across the country. However, not all jurisdictions report data disaggregated by facility.

We currently collect and report facility-level data from:

- the Federal Bureau of Prisons, which includes federal facilities located in Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia
- X state correctional agencies
- X county correctional agencies

We currently collect and report aggregate data from:

- X state correctional agencies, including the District of Columbia Department of Correction
- X county correctional agencies

We compile the results into a spreadsheet we maintain on GitHub. When data are not available publicly, we make every effort to obtain information through public records requests. In some cases, we also partner with other organizations who gather data directly from agencies.

### Core prison and jail variables: definitions and considerations

#### Cumulative Cases

- **Residents.Confirmed:** The cumulative number of confirmed Covid-19 cases among incarcerated persons at a federal, state, or county facility.
- **Staff.Confirmed:** The cumulative number of confirmed Covid-19 cases among corrections staff members at a federal, state, or county facility.
- **Considerations:** In many cases, agencies consider “cumulative cases” to mean the number of individuals who were ever at a facility who have ever had Covid-19. However, some agencies, such as the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, consider “cumulative cases” to mean the number of individuals who currently reside in a facility who have ever had Covid-19. Therefore, the facility-level value can decrease as people are transfered or released.<br /><br />Some agencies also reduce the cumulative count if someone dies or recovers from Covid-19. In these instances, we calculate the cumulative case count by summing their reported number of recovered cases, number of deaths, and number of confirmed cases. For more details on individual state practices, see the section “Notes about Individual States” in our data dictionary. <br /><br /> Not all agencies report data on staff Covid-19 cases.<br /><br /> Another important consideration is that testing practices vary widely by correctional agency, and we are not always able to collect testing data. Low levels of testing mean that the total of cumulative cases is underreported.

#### Active Cases

- **Residents.Active:** the number of individuals currently incarcerated at the facility who have an active infection of Covid-19 and have not been medically cleared to return to the general incarcerated population.
- **Staff.Active:** the number of individuals currently working at the facility who have an active infection of Covid-19 and have not been medically cleared to return to the general incarcerated population.
- **Considerations:** It is not always clear if an agency distinguishes between active cases (those who have Covid-19 now) and cumulative cases (those who have ever had Covid-19). As we continue to collect data, we are gradually learning the nuances of each agency’s reporting. <br /><br /> Not all agencies report data on staff Covid-19 cases. <br /><br />Another important consideration is that testing practices vary widely by correctional agency, and we are not always able to collect testing data. Low levels of testing mean that the total of active cases is underreported.

#### Deaths

- **Residents.Deaths:** The cumulative number of incarcerated persons who have died from Covid-19 at a federal, state, or county facility.
- **Staff.Deaths:** The cumulative number of corrections staff who have died from Covid-19 at a federal, state, or county facility.
- **Considerations:** We are not always able to collect data on Covid-19-related mortality at the facility level -- many correctional agencies report this number in aggregate the state level. Furthermore, there is no standard for how to report this number -- some agencies include all deaths suspected of being related to Covid-19, while others include only those with a positive test result. There are examples of correctional agencies underreporting Covid-19-related deaths by assigning another cause of death, even when the deceased had or were suspected to have been infected. <br /><br /> If a news source reports deaths that a correctional agency has not yet reported, we add the deaths to our data’s count. If this occurs, we make a note of it in the Add’l.Notes column. This is the only instance in which we enter information from a news source that might conflict with an agency’s reported data. <br /><br />Finally, not all agencies report data on staff deaths related to Covid-19.

#### Tests

- **Residents.Tested:** The cumulative number of incarcerated persons tested for COVID-19, or the cumulative number of tests performed of incarcerated persons.
- **Staff.Tested:** The cumulative number of corrections staff tested for COVID-19, or the cumulative number of tests performed of corrections staff.
- **Considerations:** Some agencies report the number of persons tested, while others report the number of tests administered. It is not always clear which. We record whichever number is available. A link to information directly from the agency about how each state reports testing data can be found in the “Sources” column of our dataset on GitHub.

### How We Calculate Rates of Infection and Death Among Incarcerated People in Prisons and Jails

Our website displays approximate rates for cumulative cases, active cases, and deaths among incarcerated people at the facility level. We calculate these rates by dividing the total number of infections or deaths at a facility (numerator) by the total number of people incarcerated at that facility (denominator). On each state page, we aggregate the numerators and denominators for all facilities in that state to come up with an approximate statewide rate.

For the denominators, we elected to use the latest reported facility populations as of February 2020 -- the start of the pandemic -- because the majority of correctional agencies do not regularly report up-to-date facility populations that account for releases, intake, and movement between facilities. Since no reported population count can be accurately up-to-date, and we are reporting cumulative counts since the start of the pandemic, we chose to align our population denominators with the data available at that point in time.

It is important to note that facility populations are reported in aggregate rather than at the individual case level. Aggregate reporting, combined with the fact that prison and jail populations turn over frequently, make it impossible to determine whether people who have been infected with Covid-19 at some point during the pandemic are still among those incarcerated. As a result, the universe of people for the infection and death counts (numerators) is not necessarily the same as the universe for the population counts (denominators). Eventually, this may mean that some numerators exceed the denominators.

We compiled our February 2020 population dataset through a combination of scraping agency websites, submitting public records requests to correctional agencies, and filling in gaps with Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data.

We do not yet have accurate and/or comparable totals for staff at all facilities. As a result, we are not currently providing rates for staff, but we plan to in the future.

### Court Filing Data

Our project collaborates with the Bronx Defenders, Columbia Law School’s Center for Institutional and Social Change, and Zealous to collect information on court filings related to Covid-19 and incarceration in courts across across the country. Our team reads and codes each filing in the Health is Justice court filing database.
We also collect data on youth and immigration court filings. For these data, we ask advocates to self-report about relevant filings using this form for youth filings and this form for immigration filings.  
Our court fillings data reflect only those filings we know of, and are by no means exhaustive.

### Prison and Jail Release Data

We collect data on court efforts to release incarcerated people from prisons and jails for reasons related to Covid-19. We generally gather data through media sources, though we also ask advocates to self-report release efforts via this form. Our releases data reflect only those release efforts we know of, and are by no means exhaustive.

### Immigration Detention Data

Our team collects data on Covid-19 infections and deaths for detainees and staff within U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities across the United States. Our data come directly from ICE’s website and are updated on X basis. Our data reflect what is reported by ICE directly, and infection and death counts may be underreported.

### Youth Corrections Data

We gather data on Covid-19 in youth correctional facilities directly from state and county juvenile corrections websites. Many states and counties either underreport or neglect to report data altogether on youth incarceration. These data are supplemented with news reports. Our youth corrections data reflect only those Covid-19 cases we know of, and are by no means exhaustive.

### Grassroots Organizing Data

We collect data on Covid-19-related grassroots actions and fundraisers organized inside and outside of facilities. Our team gathers data from the media, and we ask organizers to self-report on their work through this form. Our grassroots organizing data reflect only those efforts we know of, and are by no means exhaustive.

## FAQs

### How do you collect your data?

Please see our methodology for information on how we collect data.

### What makes this project distinct from others tracking Covid-19 in the correctional context?

There are a number of other organizations and initiatives, such as The Marshall Project, Vera Institute of Justice, X, and X doing the important work of collecting and reporting on Covid-19 data in carceral facilities. What sets our project apart is that we collect and report prison, jail, youth detention, and immigration detention data at the facility level, in addition to state-level reporting. You may notice that our state-level case and death totals differ from those reported by other organizations, and those discrepancies are due to differences in data collection methods.

### Which prisons and jails are reporting facility-level data?

We aim to collect and report Covid-19 facility-level data, where possible, for all prisons and jails across the country. However, not all jurisdictions report data disaggregated by facility.

We currently collect and report facility-level data from:

- The Federal Bureau of Prisons, which includes federal facilities located in Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia
- X state correctional agencies
- X county correctional agencies

Our data on youth and immigration detention is also collected and reported at the facility level.

We currently collect and report aggregate state or county-wide data from:

- X state correctional agencies, including the District of Columbia Department of Correction
- X county correctional agencies

### How often do you update your data?

We aim to keep our data as current as possible by collecting new data three to four times per week, but because correctional agencies update their data on varying schedules, some lags in reporting are inevitable. We have noted in our datasets when we last updated the data for a particular facility or jurisdiction.

### Are the deaths you’re reporting Covid-19 specific, or deaths from any cause?

We report Covid-19 specific deaths. There have been instances where deaths suspected of being related to Covid-19 were classified as due to another cause. Therefore, it is reasonable to suspect underreporting of deaths. This applies to both the prison and jail dataset and the immigration detention dataset.

### Can we compare data from one jurisdiction to another?

It can be complicated to compare data between jurisdictions, because variable definitions sometimes vary. We recommend consulting the “Sources” column in our prison and jail dataset on GitHub for specific information directly from correctional agencies. It is important to note that not all jurisdictions clearly define their variables. Our team is working on harmonizing the data to the extent possible to enable better comparisons in the future.

### Why don’t you have more data from jails?

We collect data for the major jail systems in Los Angeles, New York City, and Chicago, as well as for jails in X other counties.

Because jails fall under the jurisdiction of counties, rather than states, the number of jurisdictions we would need to extract data from in order to report on all jails far exceeds our capacity for the time being. In some cases, we have partnered with other initiatives who track jail data and incorporate their data into our database. For example, we partner with a team of researchers at Davis Vanguard to report data on Alameda, Fresno, Orange, Sacramento, San Francisco, Santa Clara, Solano, and Yolo county jails in California.

### How do you calculate rates?

Please see our methodology section to learn how we calculate rates.

### Who do you consider to be staff?

We try to include only staff who work within facility walls, such as corrections officers, health personnel, or other custodial staff. Administrative staff and non-custodial employees typically do not work in prisons and jails, and are thus not “behind bars.” When a correctional agency does not distinguish between different types of staff in its reporting, we include data for all staff. Jurisdictions who do not distinguish staff roles will have relatively higher counts for staff.

### Why do your total case or death count for X jurisdiction decrease?

Our data reflect the totals that correctional agencies provide on their websites, though we are occasionally able to supplement this information with public information requests and media reports. At times, correctional agencies change the data they report or the manner in which they report it, resulting in occasional fluctuations in the numbers we display.

### Why don’t you report case and death rates for staff?

We do not yet have accurate and/or comparable totals of staff for a majority of facilities. As a result, we are not currently providing rates for staff, but we plan to in the future.
