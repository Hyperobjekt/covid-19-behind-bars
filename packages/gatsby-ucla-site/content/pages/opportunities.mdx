We welcome volunteers of all ages. We ask our volunteers for a minimum commitment of 4 hours a week for at least 6 consecutive weeks, but we are also open to alternatives.

**Position Available: Research and Policy Fellow**

The UCLA Law COVID-19 Behind Bars Data Project seeks to hire a limited-term research and policy fellow for a period of at least six months to assist with our team’s efforts to analyze and educate the public about the impacts of the pandemic on incarcerated people and carceral institutions, as well as the measures taken by criminal legal system actors in response.

Founded shortly after the pandemic began, the Data Project has grown quickly into a leading research center.  Among many other initiatives, we have produced heavily cited research in journals such as JAMA on the rates of infection and death among incarcerated people and correctional staff, presented testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee and the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, and shared our insights on dozens of panels and with numerous reporters.  We have collaborated with researchers from a wide array of other academic and non-profit institutions, and serve as the CDC’s official source for data on COVID in prisons.  Our website, uclacovidbehindbars.org, makes the data we collect easily accessible, and our blog offers highlights of our work.

In collaboration with the project's faculty leadership, manager of stakeholder relations, four data scientists, staff writer, and dedicated corps of volunteers, the Research and Policy Fellow will help to carry forward ongoing projects, such as a report on the use of state-law compassionate release provisions, an investigation of mortality under-reporting, and a series of projects related to data transparency.  In addition, we hope the Fellow will generate, develop, and actualize ideas for additional research.  We seek to hire someone with initiative who thrives on teamwork.  The successful candidate will have strong writing skills and experience articulating the import of both quantitative and qualitative data to a broad audience.  We seek a fellow who has significant familiarity with the criminal legal system; people who have been directly impacted by it are strongly encouraged to apply.  A relevant undergraduate or graduate degree is a plus, but no particular educational background is required.

This position will begin immediately and is funded for an initial term of six months of full-time work, with a possible extension depending on need and funding.  The work will be remote; applicants need not reside in California.  They will be supervised by Professor Sharon Dolovich, Director of the Prison Law and Policy Program, and Aaron Littman, Binder Clinical Teaching Fellow, both of the UCLA School of Law.  The salary will be $55,000 per annum, paid on a monthly basis, with limited benefits including health insurance.  To apply, please send a cover letter explaining your interest in and qualifications for the position, resume, and list of references to Trinh Bui at [bui@law.ucla.edu](mailto:bui@law.ucla.edu "mailto\:bui@law.ucla.edu"), with the following subject line: "Research and Policy Fellow Application -- \[Your Last Name]".  Applications will be accepted and reviewed on a rolling basis beginning immediately.

UCLA is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, or protected Veteran status.
