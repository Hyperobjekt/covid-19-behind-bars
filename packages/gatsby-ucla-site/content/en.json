Agencies differ in the number and definitions of variables they report about vaccination, but, to the best of our knowledge, the numbers reported here refer to the number of people who have received <u>at least</u> one dose of a vaccine. Some individuals may have also received a second dose, though it is not always clear from the data. We will add jurisdictions to this table as more data become available.",

The population value used to calculate the vaccination rate for incarcerated people is from January 2021, and the population value used for staff is the most recent data available. Many of the staff population denominators come from the Marshall Projectâ€™s data.",
