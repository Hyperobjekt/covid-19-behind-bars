  title: COVID-19 in ICE Detention
  subtitle: UCLA Law
  body:
    Our immigration detention research team collects data on the number of people detained by U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) across the country who have been infected with or died from COVID-19. Our data come directly from ICEâ€™s website and are updated several times per week.

  note:
    - Actual COVID-19 case counts are likely much higher than reported by ICE, as testing by the agency has been limited.
    - Rates are calculated using a denominator of average facility-level population for 2020. Populations have decreased significantly over the course of the pandemic.
