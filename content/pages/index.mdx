  title: COVID-19 behind bars data project
  subtitle: UCLA Law
  body:
    We collect and report data on COVID-19 in prisons, jails, and immigration detention centers, as well as pandemic-related prison
    and jail releases, legal filings and court orders, and grassroots and community organizing efforts.
    Our team is still in the process of adding all of our facility-level data to the national and state maps.
    Please check back regularly for updates.

  note:
    - Testing and reporting practices vary widely by correctional agency. True case and mortality counts are likely higher and may be significantly higher than reported.
    - Rates are calculated using a denominator of facility-level population as of February 2020. See our methodology to learn more about why we chose this approach.
