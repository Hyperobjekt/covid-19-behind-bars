## Opportunities

The UCLA Law COVID Behind Bars Data Project is looking for volunteers to help us track and analyze COVID-19 infections and deaths in prisons and jails.

We welcome volunteers of all ages. We ask our volunteers for a minimum commitment of 4 hours a week for at least 6 consecutive weeks, but we are also open to alternatives. If you are interested in joining us, please email Danielle Flores at floresd@law.ucla.edu, with your availability and a short description of why you want to volunteer with the Project.

The UCLA Law COVID Behind Bars Data Project values equity and inclusion and encourages a diversity of candidates from various backgrounds to contact us. We especially welcome the participation of people who have been directly impacted by the criminal legal system.
